      <h2>Steve Jobs History</h2>
      <p>
        Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.
        Steve and Wozniak had a vision of changing the way people view
        computers, they wanted to make computers small enough for to have them
        in their homes or offices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve and Wozniak started building the Apple I in Job's garage and sold
        them without a monitor, keyboard, or casing. The Apple II revolutionized
        the computer industry wiht the introduction of the first ever color
        graphics. In 1980 Apple went public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve Wozniak left apple in 1983 due to a lack of interest in the day to
        day running of Apple Computers. Jobs then hired Pepsi exectutive John
        Sculley which backfired on him and led to Jobs getting fired in 1985.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Apple's sales peak in 1990, Apple's market share started to suffer
        and the company was expected to be doomed. It was not until 1997, when
        Apple was desperately need of an operating system and they bought out
        NeXT Software (Steve Jobs' Company). Steve Jobs became interim CEO (he
        was officially CEO in 2000). In Apple, Steve revamped the computers and
        introduced the iBook followed by the iPod, which became market leader.

        2007 was the year the phone was revolutionized. The iPhone was
        introduced to the world, a touch screen cellular device that can take
        pictures, download apps, send messages, and more. Since 2007, Apple have
        made a new iPhone every single year. In 2018, Apple was the first valued
        company to reach one trillion dollars and in two year it doubled that
        figure.
